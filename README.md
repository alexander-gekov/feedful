## A Note from the Creator

Hi everyone!

I initially created Feedful as a modern RSS reader for power readers. Due to various reasons(fulltime work, other projects etc), I kinda abandoned the project, and the user base eventually dwindled and I feel like there's no reason to renew the domain.

However, I did not kill the project completely. I've decided to make the project open source so that the community can benefit from it or even take it forward.

You can still access the project at [feedful.vercel.app](https://feedful.vercel.app).

Happy reading!
